The Search ContinuesMy Experience Searching for a SWE InternshipThe past month has been filled with applications for Software Engineering Internships and subsequent prepration for interviews.  Computer Science is one of the few fields where by a candidate can be tested on the spot and expected to demonstrate compotency of the material they are supposed to know.  It is quite daunting but it is an excellent litmus test.  While I haven't taken a formal Data Structures course yet, I've been exposed to the concepts and have had to clean up some knowledge gaps on the side (huge shout out to geeks for geeks!). I never thought I would enjoy preparing for a job interview but the tools and tricks I've learned along the way have kept me genuinely intrigued, hungry for more, and sometimes perplexed.  
My language of choice for interview prep is Python.  It's simplicity is paramount but i'm begining to see the differences in the language and why others trend to Java and C++.  Nevertheless, seeing someone write one line of code for a solution that you have written a novel for is eye opening, discouraging, and enlightening all at the same time!  It's always a trip to see the most "Pythonic" solution to a problem...
As the semester comes to an end, I'll be sure to provide a wrap up of the courses I've taken but in the interim, here is a presentation I did on one of the most influential people in the business, John Carmack.  He's the stuff of legend and his story is one every programmer should listen to.  One of the most important sources for the presentation was John Carmack's Interview with Lex Fridman.  If you have the time to listen to it, I cannot recommend it enough.  Enjoy!
