    <!-- First Entry -->
    <p>The following is a synopsis of the courses I took in my first semester of the UNF Computer Science Post-Bacc student. 
      This post is meant to serve as a guidepost for those who are interested in following a similiar path, and in no way a 
      comprehensive criticism or endorsement of UNF.
    </p>
    <h1>Computational Structures</h1>
    <p>"Computer Science is just Math." This is a gross oversimplification of the field of Computer Science, but it's truth still holds.  
      Discrete mathematics are the foundation for much of the computational thinking that goes into designing and implementing algorithms 
      and this course was an introduction to those concepts.  Right off the bat, I’ll note that UNF’s Computational Structures was slightly 
      lacking in some of the more important concepts of Discrete Mathematics, such as graph theory, but they do offer a 
      Computational Structures 2 (which I’m currently enrolled in) that cleans up the rest. In this course, we covered the foundations 
      beginning with predicate logic and traversed through Boolean algebra, algorithm complexity, modulo arithmetic, combinatorics, and 
      probability.  All in all it was great to see the origins of the discipline and more importantly, learn the material that will 
      ultimately help me be a better programmer.  
    </p>
    <h1>Programming I</h1>
    <p>This course was taught using the C programming language, and while I began the semester with a fuss about why on earth I’d want 
      to learn C, I ended with a new found appreciation for a language that has served as the backbone for many modern languages.  
      Learning to program in C takes away all your crutches and forces you to pay attention to even the most trivial things.  
      This course was exceptionally basic in the beginning focusing on the fundamentals such as conditionals, loops, arrays and I/O.  
      But towards the end, we delved into what makes C such a powerful (and sometimes confusing) tool; Pointers and memory allocation.  
      Again, when programming in C, especially when utilizing pointers, one must actually understand the details of what the code is doing 
      in order to write effective code.  It was a fun ride and I am happy to say that after this course I went out an purchased a C book 
      to continue my adventure coding in this awesome language.    
    </p>
    <h1> Programming II</h1>
    <p>The follow up to Programming was a headfirst leap into OOP using Java.  Java is a great language to learn OOP
      and anyone who’s made a “hello world” program in the language will see, that you must start with a class and a main method.  
      After reviewing the nuances of Java we jumped into OOP learning the intricacies of inheritance, abstract classes, and interfaces.  
      All the while implementing I/O, GUIs, and file handling.  I look forward to continuing my journey with Java as many of the upper 
      level courses rely heavily on the language
    </p>
    <h1> Probability and Statistics for Engineers</h1>
    <p>
      Another course that plagued me in earlier years came full circle to appreciation.  I’ve never been a fan of this pseudo-mathematics until 
      I saw it’s utility in so many aspects of computer science.  The field that jumps out to me most is Machine Learning and AI.  My limited 
      scope of these disciplines recognizes that statistics and probability are essential and this knowledge helped frame my approach in this
       course.  Just as discrete mathematics are essential for any programmer, Prob/Stats are essential for anyone hoping to break away from the 
       simple and delve into the next era of technology.
    </p>
    <h1>Public Speaking for Professionals</h1>
    <p>
      I went into this course with quite a sour attitude having spent the better part of my adult life speaking publicly in front of 
      people far more important than myself.  But, I quickly shaped up and instead viewed it as an opportunity to hone my skills.  
      Almost immediately I realized how poor my email writing skills were and was grateful to correct something I’d done literally 
      thousands of times.  The projects were a great reorientation into research in the 2020’s. All in all, it was a good experience 
      I’m happy to have behind me.
