    <p>The past month has been filled with applications for Software Engineering Internships and subsequent prepration for interviews.  Computer Science is one of the few fields where by a candidate 
      can be tested on the spot and expected to demonstrate compotency of the material they are supposed to know.  It is quite daunting but it is an excellent litmus test.  While I haven't taken a formal 
      Data Structures course yet, I've been exposed to the concepts and have had to clean up some knowledge gaps on the side (huge shout out to 
      <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/?ref=shm" target="_blank">geeks for geeks!</a>). I never thought I would enjoy preparing for a 
      job interview but the tools and tricks I've learned along the way have kept me genuinely intrigued, hungry for more, and sometimes perplexed. </p>
    <p>My language of choice for interview prep is Python.  It's simplicity is paramount but i'm begining to see the differences in the language and why others trend to Java and C++.  
      Nevertheless, seeing someone write one line of code for a solution that you have written a novel for is eye opening, discouraging, and enlightening all at the same time!  
      It's always a trip to see the most "Pythonic" solution to a problem...</p>
    <p>As the semester comes to an end, I'll be sure to provide a wrap up of the courses I've taken but in the interim, here is a presentation I did on one of the most influential people in the business, 
      John Carmack.  He's the stuff of legend and his story is one every programmer should listen to.  One of the most important sources for the presentation was 
      <a href="https://lexfridman.com/john-carmack/" target="_blank">John Carmack's Interview with Lex Fridman.</a>  
      If you have the time to listen to it, I cannot recommend it enough.  Enjoy!</p>

    <h1 id="Custom_HTML_Elements">Custom HTML Elements</h1>
    <p>I got a lot of mileage out of custom HTML Elements for this website.  One situation was in order to differentiate my 'About Me' and 'blog' page I wanted to update the header content, 
        specifically the drop down menu for the posts.  As I make changes to the header as time goes on, I can update the one javascript file and avoid missing a copy/paste along the way.  The code is below:</p>
    <div class="code-box">
      <p><span class="key-word">class</span> <span class="class">Header</span> <span class="key-word">extends</span> <span class="class">HTMLElement</span>  <span class="curly">{</span></p>
      <p>&ensp;<span class="key-word">constructor</span><span class="paren">() {</span> </p>
      <p>&ensp;&ensp;<span class="key-word">super()</span><span>;</span></p>
      <p>&ensp;&ensp;<span class="method">connectedCallback</span><span class="paren">() {</span></p>
      <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class="key-word">this</span>.<span class="variable">innerHTML</span> = <span class="variable">constructorString</span>;</p>
      <p>&ensp;&ensp;<span class="curly">}</span></p>
      <p><span class="variable">customElements</span>.<span class="method">define</span><span class="curly">(</span><span class="string">'header-content'</span>,<span class="class">Header</span> <span class="curly">)</span>;</p>
    </div>
    <p>It's important to note the new custom element name must be >2 strings connected by '-'.  I unfortunately learned this the hard way...</p>
    <p>The variable constructorString was a Template Literal that I had put together with conditionals based on what menus would/would not be visible.  As always, my code is in my

    <h1 id="Now_for_Some_Automation">Now for Some Automation</h1>
    <p>When I decided to make my own website, it was important to me to do it from scratch.  It’s foolish at times to reinvent the wheel and can even be looked at unfavorably, 
        but this was first and foremost a learning experience for me.  Needless to say, I learned a tremendous amount along the way.  </p>
    <p>One of the pitfalls of doing it your own way is simple things like updating a blog entry can become cumbersome.  For each entry I had to update three files (the HTML for the index, 
          the XML for the feed, and the javascript for the drop down menu in the header).  This would require some copy/pasting and wouldn’t be too complicated, but it left it open to mistakes.  
          In the continuing effort to learn I set out to make a program to automate the updating of these three files and am really excited at how it turned out.  
          I’ve posted the code to my <a href="https://github.com/Jordan-Gallivan/Website-Maintenance--" target="_blank">Github</a> and a short synopsis is below:</p>
    <p>In each of the three files that would need to be updated I added a “catch comment” that would serve as the anchor point for me to insert the required code for each blog entry.  
        The HTML and XML simply required me to generate some tags around the content and write it into the file at that location.  The javascript was slightly more complicated and required me to add a 
        key:value pair to the object being used in the drop down menu.  For that I located the “{“ and concatenated the strings around the new key:value pair.  It’s been a little while since I wrote python 
          so I was excited to get back into it.  Feel free to check out it out! </p>
    
    <h1 id="How_did_I_get_here">How did I get here?</h1>
    <p> It's hard to complain when you get to ride in the back seat of a fighter jet.  
        Despite how awesome that part of the job was, it never made me truly happy.  
        As my 10-year career in the Marine Corps came to an end, I knew it was time for a change.  
        What that change would be however, gave me quite a bit of consternation.  
        So, I fell back on what has always given me a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment, coding.  </p>
    <p>I had dabbled in coding projects since college, and it wasn’t until I sat down and committed to <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT’s OpenCourseWare</a> 
        introduction to programming course that I realized computer science is so much more than just writing lines of code.  
        There’s a science (duh…) to it that goes deeper than conditionals and loops.  On top of all of that is the art of writing good code.  I found I genuinely enjoyed learning about the material and putting it to use in the 
        <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/" target="_blank">MIT 6.0001</a>/
        <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/" target="_blank">2</a> problem sets.  </p>
    <p>Then I tried my hand at the discrete math course, <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/" target="_blank">6.042</a>… 
        It was here that being out of college for over 10 years and the limitations of teaching myself smashed into me with unrelenting force.  I was enthralled by the material and felt like Matt 
        Damon in Goodwill Hunting when I solved a problem, but many hours were spent trying to understand the concepts and even more were spent on trying to do the problem sets.   It was decided then; 
        I would go back to college as a 34 year old, sit in the front of class and soak up as much as I could.  I chose University of North Florida because my wife is doing a Surgical Residency at 
        University of Florida Jacksonville and it’s finally an opportunity for her, myself and our 2 year old son to all live in the same place.  </p>
    <p>I’ll chronicle my journey here for those who are interested.  The focus of this blog will be on what courses a computer science major can expect, centered around the curriculum of University of North Florida.  
        Much like I’m dusting off my html skills to make this, I’ll include side projects as I go along.</p>
    <p>Thanks for tuning in!</p>

    <h1 id="It_cant_be_that_hard">It can't be that hard</h1>
    <p>When I set out to make my first-ish website, the first thing that crossed my mind was “it can’t be that hard”.  The last time I had written HTML was in college and in 2011 there wasn’t a whole lot to it.  
        I had taken a lot of shortcuts in styling the website, kept it simple in terms of images and links, and overall remembered it as a good time.</p>
    <p>A fair amount has changed since 2011… This time around I wanted to do it right, so I jumped headfirst into javascript.  Again, I foolishly thought, “I know java, so how hard can it be?” 
        With the hour of free time a night I could steal after the family went to bed, I found out how very wrong I was.  I excitedly poured over w3 schools and MDN and found myself down rabbit holes I didn’t know existed.  
        But the end product is here.  It still has a long way to go, but now I have something I can continually make changes to as I learn javascript and the nuances of HTML.</p>
